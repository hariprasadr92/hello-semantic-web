# hello-semantic-web
My adventures exploring RDF, Apache jena , SPARQL as part of master's coursework

In this small project, I have 

* constracted Turtles and RDF files. 
* read them using Apache Jena package.
* used SPARL to query the files
* used SPARL to query DB pedia.

On the whole, constructed a Java project that Queries DB pedia based on the data in the local RDF file. This was done as pary of learning and exploring sematic web.
